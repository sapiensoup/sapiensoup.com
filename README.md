# sapiensoup.com

This repository contains the source code for the <https://sapiensoup.com> blog. [Posts](_posts) and pages are written in Markdown and/or HTML and the complete site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). See <https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/> for details.


## One-time setup

    git clone https://github.com/sapiensoup/sapiensoup.com.git
    cd sapiensoup.com
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

See <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll> for further details.


## To view the site locally

In the same `sapiensoup.com` directory cloned above, run the following commands:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    open http://localhost:4000

Changes made to files in the `_posts` directory and elsewhere should now show up automatically (i.e. without need for refresh), thanks to the `--livereload` option passed to `jekyll` above.


## To publish

Once local changes are committed and pushed, publication happens automatically via GitHub Pages. See https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/ for further details.
