Marlene Rupp: independent science writer, blogger and infographic designer. In my actual day job I'm a marketing and account manager in a big tech company.

Why do I write a blog? We live in a fantastic, yet confusing time. Going by gut feeling has led me down some not so good paths. I believe that science is a more trustworthy guide in a world that has become too complex for one person to understand. In order to make up my own mind, I obsessively research things in depth. At some point I thought _'Maybe others might be interested as well?'_, so I started to write. Because nothing helps understanding as much as charts and illustrations, I started designing infographics as well.

I love extracting the essence out of complex topics and present them in ways that are easy to understand. Contact me if you want to pay me money for that.
